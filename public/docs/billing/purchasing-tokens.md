# Purchasing Tokens

Buy additional AI tokens to extend your development capabilities beyond your plan's included allocation.

---

## Overview

Tokens power AI interactions in Yomake. Your plan includes a monthly allocation, but you can purchase additional tokens when needed for larger projects or heavy usage periods.

---

## Understanding Tokens

### What Are Tokens?

**Tokens Measure AI Usage:**
- ~4 characters = 1 token
- Both prompts and responses count
- Different models use tokens differently
- Tokens = "AI currency"

**Example:**
```
Your prompt: "Add a contact form" = ~5 tokens
AI response: "I'll create..." (500 words) = ~600 tokens
Total conversation: ~605 tokens used
```

### Included Tokens by Plan

## Token Usage Order

1. **Monthly included tokens** used first
2. **Purchased tokens** used after included exhausted
3. **Rollover tokens** (if applicable) used last

**Example:**
```
Your Plan: 500K/month included
Purchased: 100K tokens bought
Usage: You've used 450K this month

Remaining:
  - 50K from monthly allocation
  - 100K from purchase
  = 150K total available
```

## Token Optimization

### Reduce Token Usage

**Write Efficient Prompts:**
```
❌ Less Efficient:
"Can you please help me by creating a nice looking button component that has some hover effects and looks modern and professional and uses Tailwind CSS classes?"
= ~30 tokens

✅ More Efficient:
"Create a button component with hover effects using Tailwind CSS"
= ~12 tokens
```

**Best Practices:**
- Be concise and specific
- Avoid unnecessary words
- Break large requests into steps
- Use clear language
- Reference existing code

### Monitor High-Usage Activities

**Token-Heavy Operations:**
- Complex code generation
- Large file refactoring
- Extensive explanations
- Multiple iterations
- Real-time pair programming

**Optimize:**
- Plan changes before requesting
- Use preview to minimize iterations
- Build incrementally
- Cache common responses

---

## Team Token Management

### Shared Token Pool

**How Teams Work:**
- All team members share project tokens
- Owner's token balance used
- Track usage by member
- Set individual limits

### Per-Member Limits

**Set Usage Limits:**
1. Go to **Settings > Team > Token Limits**
2. Enable **"Per-Member Limits"**
3. Set daily/monthly caps per user
4. Notifications when approaching limit

**Example:**
```
Team Setup:
  - John (Admin): 50K tokens/month
  - Jane (Editor): 30K tokens/month
  - Bob (Editor): 30K tokens/month
  - Client (Viewer): 0 tokens (no AI access)

Total Pool: 500K/month from plan
```
