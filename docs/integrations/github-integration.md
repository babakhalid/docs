- Branch-based deployment

**Current workaround:**
- Create branches manually on GitHub
- Clone locally to work
- Push back to GitHub
- Import changes to Yomake

---

### Pull Requests

**Professional workflow:**

2. Push to GitHub
3. Create pull request on GitHub
4. Request code review
5. Merge after approval

**Use cases:**
- Team collaboration
- Code review process
- Quality control
- Compliance requirements

## Collaboration Workflows

### Solo Developer

**Your personal backup:**
```
Yomake (build) → GitHub (backup) → Vercel (deploy)
```

- Build in Yomake
- Sync to GitHub for backup
- Auto-deploy to Vercel
- Full history and version control

---

### Small Team

**Designer + Developer:**
```
Designer (Yomake) → GitHub → Developer (local)
                              ↓
                          GitHub → Vercel
```

- Designer builds in Yomake
- Pushes to GitHub
- Developer pulls and adds features
- Pushes back to GitHub
- Vercel deploys changes

---

### Agency Workflow

**Multiple projects and clients:**
```
Project Manager (Yomake) → GitHub → Team Review → Deploy
```

- PM creates initial structure
- Syncs to GitHub for client
- Team reviews code
- Client approves
- Deploy to production

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

**"Unable to connect to GitHub"**

**Check:**
1. GitHub.com is accessible
2. You're logged into GitHub
3. Browser allows popups
4. Correct GitHub account

**Fix:**
1. Disconnect integration
2. Clear browser cache
3. Reconnect GitHub
4. Re-authorize Yomake

---

### Push Failed

**"Error pushing to GitHub"**

**Common causes:**

**1. Repository doesn't exist:**
- Check repository name
- Verify it's created on GitHub
- Re-link repository

**2. Permission denied:**
- Check Yomake has write access
- Review GitHub app permissions
- Re-authorize if needed

**3. Branch protected:**
- GitHub branch protection enabled
- Disable protection or use PR workflow
- Or push to different branch

**4. Merge conflict:**
- Changes made directly on GitHub
- Pull latest changes first
- Resolve conflicts manually

---

### Repository Not Listed

**Can't find repo in dropdown:**

**Causes:**
- Repository access not granted
- Yomake only has access to selected repos
- New repository created after connection

**Fix:**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/installations)
2. Find "Yomake" app
3. Click "Configure"
4. Update repository access
5. Grant access to missing repo
6. Return to Yomake and refresh

---

### Sync Out of Date

**"Your GitHub repo has changes not in Yomake"**

**Scenarios:**
- Committed directly on GitHub
- Team member pushed changes
- Merged PR from outside Yomake

**Resolution:**
1. Download latest from GitHub
2. Manually merge with Yomake project
3. Or start fresh from GitHub

**Future feature:** Two-way sync coming soon

---

## Best Practices

### Commit Frequently
- Push to GitHub after major changes
- Don't wait days between syncs
- Each feature gets its own commit
- Easier to track and revert

### Write Clear Commit Messages
- Edit auto-generated messages
- Add context about why, not just what
- Reference related issues
- Follow team conventions

### Use Branch Protection
**Protect your main branch:**
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Branches → Add rule
3. Enable:
   - Require pull requests
   - Require reviews
   - Status checks

### Keep Repositories Private
- Unless intentionally open source
- Protects your code
- Prevents unauthorized access
- GitHub free includes private repos

### Regular Backups
- Even with GitHub, export code locally
- Multiple backup locations
- Protection against account issues

---

## Security

### Access Tokens

**How Yomake accesses GitHub:**
- OAuth token stored encrypted
- Token has limited scope
- Refreshed automatically
- Revocable anytime

**Token permissions:**
- Read/write repository contents
- Create commits
- Manage webhooks (for deployments)

### Revoke Access

**To remove Yomake's access:**

1. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/installations)
2. Find "Yomake" in Applications
3. Click "Configure"
4. Click "Uninstall" or modify permissions
5. Confirm removal

**Effect:**
- Yomake can no longer access your repos
- Existing code on GitHub remains
- Must reconnect to sync again

### Repository Security

**Keep your code safe:**
- Enable 2FA on GitHub account
- Use strong passwords
- Review access logs regularly
- Limit team member permissions
- Enable security alerts
