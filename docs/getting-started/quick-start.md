# Quick Start

Get up and running with Yomake in under 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through creating your first AI-powered web application.

## What You'll Build

In this quick start, you'll use Yomake's AI agent to build a simple landing page. No coding required—just describe what you want, and watch it come to life.

---

## Step 1: Sign In

Visit [yomake.ai](https://yomake.ai) and sign in using one of these methods:

- **Google Account** - One-click sign in with Google
- **Email** - Sign in with your email address

If you're new, you'll automatically get a free account with:
- 2 project slots
- Starter token balance
- Access to all core features

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Project

Once you're signed in, you'll see your dashboard. There are two ways to start:

### Option A: Quick Create (Recommended for first-timers)

1. Look for the prominent prompt box on your dashboard
2. Type what you want to build, for example:
   ```
   Create a landing page for a coffee subscription service with a hero section,
   pricing cards, and a contact form
   ```
3. Press Enter or click "Create"

### Option B: New Project Wizard

1. Click the "New Project" button
2. Choose a template (or start blank)
3. Give your project a name
4. Click "Create Project"

Your project will initialize in a few seconds.

## Step 3: Chat with the AI Agent

Once your project opens, you'll see:
- A **chat panel** on the left
- A **live preview** on the right

Now, describe what you want to build:

**Example starter prompts:**

```
Add a hero section with a headline "Fresh Coffee, Delivered" and a subtitle
about daily coffee delivery
```

```
Create a pricing section with three tiers: Starter ($15/month),
Premium ($25/month), and Business ($45/month)
```

```
Add a contact form with name, email, and message fields
```

The AI will:
- Understand your request
- Write the code
- Show you what it's doing
- Update the preview automatically

---

## Step 4: Watch Your App Build

As the AI works, you'll see:

1. **AI thinking process** - What it's planning to do
2. **Code changes** - Files being created or modified
3. **Terminal output** - Commands running in the background
4. **Live preview updates** - Your app taking shape in real-time

The preview on the right updates automatically after each change. You can:
- Scroll through your app
- Click interactive elements
- Test forms and buttons
- Switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile views

---

## Step 5: Refine Your App

Not quite right? Just ask the AI to adjust:

**Example refinement prompts:**

```
Make the hero headline bigger and bolder
```

```
Change the pricing section background to light blue
```

```
Add a navbar with logo and menu items
```

The AI remembers the conversation context, so you can build iteratively.

---

## Step 6: Deploy When Ready

Happy with your app? Make it live in seconds:

1. Click the **Deploy** button in the top right
2. Choose "Deploy to Yomake" (easiest option)
3. Wait a few seconds for deployment
4. Get your live URL: `yourproject.yomake.ai`

Share your URL with anyone—it's live on the internet!

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific** - The more details you provide, the better the result
- **Build incrementally** - Add features one at a time
- **Test as you go** - Check the preview after each change
- **Experiment freely** - You can always ask the AI to undo or change things
- **Use examples** - Reference designs or apps you like

## Common First Questions

**Q: How much does this cost?**
Your free account includes starter tokens. Each AI interaction uses tokens. When you run low, you can [purchase more](/docs/billing/purchasing-tokens) or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/plans-and-pricing).

**Q: Can I export the code?**
Yes! Connect GitHub in [Integrations](/docs/integrations/github-integration) to access your full codebase.

**Q: What can I actually build?**
Landing pages, web apps, dashboards, portfolios, e-commerce sites, and more. See [What Can I Build](/docs/ai-agent/what-can-i-build) for ideas.

**Q: Do I need coding knowledge?**
Not at all. Just describe what you want in plain English. The AI handles all the technical work.
