### Feature Requests

**Suggestions and ideas:**

We love hearing your ideas!

**Example email:**
```
Subject: Feature request - Auto-save AI chat history

Hi,

Would love to see auto-save for AI conversations.

Use case: Sometimes my browser crashes mid-conversation
and I lose the entire chat history. Would be great if
it saved after each message automatically.

Benefits:
- Never lose work
- Resume after browser issues
- Better user experience

Similar to how Google Docs auto-saves.

Thanks for considering!
```
